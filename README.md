# Rewst Buddy — Unofficial VS Code Extension for Rewst

> ⚠️ **Unofficial community project.** This extension is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Rewst LLC. "Rewst" is a trademark of its respective owner. Use at your own risk — for support, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/valafar741/rewst-buddy/issues), not with Rewst.

## About

Edit Rewst templates locally in VS Code instead of juggling browser tabs. Link a local file to a Rewst template, edit it with full editor tooling (git, extensions, AI agents), and sync changes back on save — with conflict detection so you don't overwrite someone else's edits.

See the [Quick Start](docs/quickstart.md) for first-time setup.

## Install

Search "rewst-buddy" in the VS Code Extensions view, or install from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JBramley.rewst-buddy).

## Quick Start

### 1. Connect a session

- Click the Rewst Buddy icon in the activity bar
- Paste your `appSession` cookie → **Connect**
- _(Or use the companion browser extension — see [Quick Start docs](docs/quickstart.md#first-time-session-setup).)_

### 2. Link a single template

- Open or create a local file
- Right-click in the **editor** or the **Explorer** on that file → **Link File to Template**
- Pick your organization and the template

Linked files show a **link badge** and a subtle tint in the Explorer. Use **Unlink from Template** from the same menus when a file is already linked.

### 3. Edit and sync

- Edit the file
- Click the status bar item (bottom-left) to enable sync-on-save
- **Save** → change syncs to Rewst (with conflict detection)

Want to pull in **every template** from an organization at once? See the [Bulk Folder Workflow](docs/quickstart.md#bulk-folder-workflow).

## Features at a glance

- Auto-sync on save with conflict detection
- Auto-fetch on open — picks up remote changes when you open a file
- `Ctrl+Click` template navigation + hover info on `template('UUID')` calls
- Template bundles — dependency-based grouping in the Explorer sidebar
- **Linked templates** view (Rewst Buddy activity bar) — linked files in the **current workspace**, grouped by Rewst organization; missing local files show a **broken-link** style icon; right-click → **Create Local File from Link** to fetch the template from Rewst and create **parent folders** as needed
- **Bulk org actions** — right-click an organization in **Linked templates** → **Download All Linked Templates** (overwrite local from Rewst) or **Upload All Linked Templates** (push local bodies to Rewst)
- **Explorer decorations** — linked files get a link badge and a configurable teal accent (theme color `rewst-buddy.linkedTemplateExplorer`)
- **Explorer context menu** — **Link File to Template** / **Unlink from Template** for files (when a session is active and the file’s link state matches)
- **`.rewst-buddy` workspace file** — optional per–workspace-folder JSON (default **on**) so template/folder links can live in the repo and update after **git pull**; disables with setting `rewst-buddy.workspaceLinksFile`
- Smart template opening — reuses existing linked files instead of creating untitled docs
- File rename support + automatic stale link cleanup
- Browser extension integration (sideload — not yet on the Chrome Web Store)
- Multi-region support

## Security & Authentication

Rewst does not publish a public API, so this extension authenticates the same way the Rewst web app does: with your browser session cookie (`appSession`, or the equivalent cookie for your region — see [Multi-Region Setup](docs/reference.md#multi-region-setup)). A companion [browser extension](https://github.com/totallynotjon/rewst-buddy-browser) automates the cookie transfer (sideload required — not yet on the Chrome Web Store).

- Your cookie is stored only in VS Code's built-in [SecretStorage](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage) (OS-level encrypted storage).
- No data is sent anywhere other than Rewst's own API.
- Sessions inherit your current Rewst permissions — the extension can do nothing you can't already do in the browser.

If you have security concerns, the codebase is MIT-licensed and open for audit — please [open an issue](https://github.com/valafar741/rewst-buddy/issues) with any findings.
